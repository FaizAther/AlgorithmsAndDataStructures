\section*{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item   
	      Consider the following algorithm, \textsc{CoolAlgorithm}, which takes a \textbf{positive} integer $n$ and outputs another integer. 
	      Recall that `$\&$' indicates the bitwise AND operation and `$a >> b$' indicates the binary representation of $a$ shifted to the right $b$ times.
	      	      
	      \begin{algorithm}
	      	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	      		\Procedure{CoolAlgorithm}{int n}
	      		\State $sum \gets 0$
	      		\If {$n$ \% $2 == 0$}
	      		\For{$i=0$ to $n$} 
	      		\For {$j=i$ to $n^2$}
	      		\State $sum \gets sum + i + j$ 
	      		\EndFor 
	      		\EndFor
	      		\Else
	      		\While{$n > 0$}
	      		\State $sum \gets sum$ + $(n$ \& $1)$
	      		\State $n \gets (n >> 1)$
	      		\EndWhile
	      		\EndIf
	      		\State \textbf{return} $sum$
	      		\EndProcedure
	      	\end{algorithmic}
	      \end{algorithm}
	      	          
	      Note that the runtime of the above algorithm depends not only on the size of the input $n$, but also on a numerical property of $n$. 
	      For all of the following questions, you must assume that $n$ is a positive integer.
	      	      
	      \begin{enumerate}
	      	\item (3 marks) Represent the running time (i.e. the number of primitive operations) of the algorithm 
	      	      when the input $n$ is \textbf{odd}, as a mathematical function called $T_{\text{odd}}(n)$. State all assumptions made and explain all your reasoning.
	      	      
	      	      \begin{Solution}
	      	      
	      	      For $n$ being odd the the execution will jump to the following block of code.
	      	      \def \theLog {\left \lceil{\log_2(n)}\right \rceil}
	      	      \def \runTime {6*\theLog{} + 2}
	      	      \begin{algorithm}
                        \begin{algorithmic}
        	      		  \State $sum \gets 0$ \Comment{1 primitive operation.}
                          \While{$n > 0$} \Comment{executed $\theLog{} + 1$ times.}
                          \State $sum \gets sum$ + $(n$ \& $1)$ \Comment{bit-wise, addition, set -- $(1+1+1) * \theLog{} $.}
                          \State $n \gets (n >> 1)$ \Comment{effectively division by 2 (right shifting by 1) and set -- $(1+1) * \theLog{}$.}
                          \EndWhile \Comment{Overall primitive operations are still $\runTime{}{}$.}
                        \end{algorithmic}
                    \end{algorithm}
                    
	      	      Assumption: Considering the code is being run on a system with the binary number representation is such that the MSB(most significant bit) is the left most bit. In that case the operation on line 12 is division by 2.
	      	    
	      	    It will take $\left \lceil{\log_2(n)}\right \rceil $ divisions  for $n$ to become equal to zero as $0$'s will be introduced to the binary number from the MSB making LSB's fall off.
	      	    
	      	    The approximate running time, $T_{\text{odd}}(n)$ is $f(n) = \runTime{}$
	      	        
	      	      \end{Solution}
	      	    
	      	      	      	                  
	      	\item (2 marks) Find a function $g(n)$ such that $T_{\text{odd}}(n)\in O(g(n))$. 
	      	      Your $g(n)$ should be such that the Big-O bound is as tight as possible (e.g. no constants or lower order terms). 
	      	      Using the formal definition of Big-O, prove this bound and explain all your reasoning. 
	      	      	      	                  
	      	      (Hint: you need to find values of $c$ and $n_0$ to prove the Big-O bound you gave is valid).
	      	      
	      	       \begin{Solution}
 	      	      \def \runTime {6 * \left \lceil{\log_2(n)}\right \rceil + 2}

	      	       
	      	       $f(n) \le c*g(n) \rightarrow \runTime{} \le c*g(n) \rightarrow c*g(n) - (\runTime{}) \geq 0$.
	      	       
	                Let $g(n)$ be equal to $\left \lceil{\log_2(n)}\right \rceil$. 
	                
	               $ (c - 6) * \left \lceil{\log_2(n)}\right \rceil - 2 \geq 0 \rightarrow (c - 6) * \left \lceil{\log_2(n)}\right \rceil \geq 2$.
	               
	               Now for $c > 0$ and $n \geq n_{\text{0}} \rightarrow n_{\text{0}} = 3$ since this is the odd case and to avoid logarithm of $1$ that is $0$ and $c = 8$ to keep the function positive and greater than two and ceiling functioncan be ignored.
	               
	               Therefore, $T_{\text{odd}}(n), f(n) = \runTime{}$ is $O(\log_2(n)))$
	      	       
	      	      \end{Solution}
	      	      	      	                  
	      	\item (2 marks) Similarly, find the tightest Big-$\Omega$ bound of $T_{\text{odd}}(n)$ and use the formal definition of Big-$\Omega$ to prove the bound is correct. Does a Big-$\Theta$ bound for $T_{\text{odd}}(n)$ exist? If so, give it. If not, explain why it doesn't exist.
	      	
	      	\begin{Solution}
	      	\def \runTime {6*\left \lceil{\log_2(n)}\right \rceil+2}

	      	       
	      	       $f(n) \geq c*g(n) \rightarrow \runTime{} \geq c*g(n) \rightarrow \runTime{} - c*g(n) \le 0$.
	      	       
	                Let $g(n)$ be equal to $\left \lceil{\log_2(n)}\right \rceil$. 
	                
	               $ (6 - c) * \left \lceil{\log_2(n)}\right \rceil + 2\le 0 \rightarrow (6 - c) * \left \lceil{\log_2(n)}\right \rceil \le -2 \rightarrow (c - 6) * \left \lceil{\log_2(n)}\right \rceil \geq 2 $.
	               
	               Now for $c > 0$ and $n \geq n_{\text{0}} \rightarrow n_{\text{0}} = 3$ since this is the odd case and to avoid logarithm of $1$ that is $0$ and $c = 8$ to keep the function positive and greater than two and ceiling function can be ignored.
	               
	               Therefore, $T_{\text{odd}}(n), f(n) = \runTime{}$ is $\Omega(\log_2(n))$
	               
	               Since $f(n)$ is $O(\log_2(n))$ and $\Omega(\log_2(n))$ fulfilling the condition $c_{\text{1}}*g(n) \le f(n) \le c_{\text{2}} * g(n)$ for all $n \geq n_{\text{0}}$ and $c_{\text{1}},c_{\text{2}} > 0$ and hence, $T_{\text{odd}}(n), f(n) = \runTime{}$ is $\Theta(\log_2(n))$.
	      	       
	      	\end{Solution}
	      	      	      	                  
	      	      	      	                  
	      	\item (3 marks) Represent the running time (as you did in part (a)) for the algorithm when the input $n$ is \textbf{even}, as a function called $T_{\text{even}}(n)$. State all assumptions made and explain all your reasoning. Also give a tight Big-O and Big-$\Omega$ bound on $T_{\text{even}}(n)$. You do \textbf{not} need to formally prove these bounds.
	      	
	      	\begin{Solution}
	      	\begin{algorithm}
	      	\begin{algorithmic}
	      		\State $sum \gets 0$ \Comment{set, primitive operation count is -- $1$}
	      		\If {$n$ \% $2 == 0$} \Comment{ mod and check -- $2$}
	      		\For{$i=0$ to $n$} \Comment{$n$}
	      		\For {$j=i$ to $n^2$} \Comment{ $n^2$}
	      		\State $sum \gets sum + i + j$ \Comment{$n*n^2 - \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}i \rightarrow n^3 - (n-1)((n-1)+1)/2 \rightarrow (2*n^3-n^2+n)/2 $}
	      		\EndFor \Comment{$(2*n^3-n^2+n)/2+n^2$}
	      		\EndFor \Comment{adding everything up $(2*n^3-n^2+n)/2+n^2+n+2+1 \rightarrow 2*n^3 + (n^2)/2 + (3/2)*n+3$}
	      		\EndIf
	      	 \end{algorithmic}
            \end{algorithm}
            
            $T_{\text{even}}(n)$, $f(n) = 2*n^3 + (n^2)/2 + (3/2)*n+3$
            
            Dropping the lower order terms and constants gives us $T_{\text{even}}(n)$, $f(n)$ is $O(n^3)$ and $\Omega(n^3)$
            
	      	\end{Solution}
	      	      	      	                  
	      	\item (2 marks) The running time for the algorithm has a best case and worst case, and which case occurs for a 
	      	      given input $n$ to the algorithm depends on the parity of $n$.
	      	      	      	                  
	      	      Give a Big-O bound on the \textbf{best case} running time of the algorithm, and a Big-$\Omega$ bound on 
	      	      the \textbf{worst case} running time of the algorithm (and state which parity of the input corresponds with which case).
	        \begin{Solution}
	        \begin{align*}
	      	      	T(n)=\begin{cases}
	      	      	T_{\text{even}}(n) & \text{if $n$ is even, worst case with $O(n^3)$.} \\
	      	      	T_{\text{odd}}(n)  & \text{if $n$ is odd best case with $\Omega(\log_2(n))$.}\\
	      	      	\end{cases}
	      	      \end{align*}
	      	\end{Solution}
	      	      	      \newpage
	      	\item (2 marks) We can represent the runtime of the entire algorithm, say $T(n)$, as
	      	      \begin{align*}
	      	      	T(n)=\begin{cases}
	      	      	T_{\text{even}}(n) & \text{if $n$ is even} \\
	      	      	T_{\text{odd}}(n)  & \text{if $n$ is odd}  \\
	      	      	\end{cases}
	      	      \end{align*}
	      	      Give a Big-$\Omega$ and Big-$O$ bound on $T(n)$ using your previous results. If a Big-$\Theta$ bound for the entire algorithm exists, describe it. If not, explain why it doesnâ€™t exist.
	      	      
	      	\begin{Solution}
	      	No, Big-$\Theta$ does not exist as the entire function for $T(n)$ is actually piece-wise for the odd and even case with different upper and lower bounds.
	      	
	      	$T(n)$ is $\Omega(\log_2(n))$ and $T(n)$ is $O(n^3)$, hence Big-$\Theta$ does not exit.
	      	\end{Solution}
	      	      	      	                  
	      	\item (2 marks) Your classmate tells you that Big-O represents the worst case runtime of an algorithm, and similarly that 
	      	      Big-$\Omega$ represents the best case runtime. Is your classmate correct? Explain why/why not. 
	      	      Your answers for (e) and (f) \textit{may} be useful for answering this.
	      	      
	      	\begin{Solution}
	      	Yes and no. Although the answer will not be very accurate as we drop the lower order terms and the constants that may affect the actual $T(n)$ but the Big-$\Omega$ will provide a $g(n)$ that are a class of functions that will give us a estimate of the best case as it is a bound on the entire $T(n)$ from below multiplied by a $c>0$. And similarly a Big-$O$ will give us a $h(n)$ multiplied with a constant $d>0$ that will be an estimate for the upper bound of the entire $T(n)$ giving us a estimate of the worst case.
	      	
	      	So, final answer is yes as for big values of $n$ we can get a fair insight on how the algorithm behaves in best and worst cases. Big values of $n$ are the ones that are actually useful.
	      	\end{Solution}
	      	      	      	                  
	      	\item (1 mark) Prove that an algorithm runs in $\Theta (g(n))$ time if and only if its worst-case running time 
	      	      is $O(g(n))$ and its best-case running time is $\Omega(g(n))$.
	      	      
	      	\begin{Solution}
	      	
	      	Worst case(high) bounded from above by $c_{\text{1}} * g(n)$ by $O(g(n))$;
	      	
	      	Best case(low) bounded from below by $c_{\text{2}} * g(n)$ by $\Omega(g(n))$;
	      	
	      	i.e. $c_{\text{2}} * g(n) \le T(n)=f(n) \le c_{\text{1}} * g(n)$ | $c_{\text{1}}$,$c_{\text{2}}>0$,  $n\geq n_{\text{0}}$;
	      	
	      	Hence, $T(n)=f(n)$ is $\Theta(g(n))$.
	      	
	      	
	      	\end{Solution}

Same goes for C or python a recursive solution creates overhead on the CPU, while the iterative solution will run in the same time complexity with reduced overhead of function stacks as well as reduced memory usage compared to recursive where memory is being held by the previous not yet destroyed function stacks to keep track of variables.

	\item  
	      The UQ water well company has marked out an $n\times n$ grid on a plot of land, in which their hydrologists know exactly 
	      one square has a suitable water source for a water well. They have access to a drill, which uses drill bits and can test one 
	      square at a time. Now, all they they need is a strategy to find this water source.
	      	         
	      Let the square containing the water source be $(s_x,s_y)$. After drilling in a square $(x,y)$, certain things can 
	      happen depending on where you drilled.
	      \begin{itemize}
	      	\item If $x > s_x$ or $y > s_y$, then the drill bit breaks and must be replaced.
	      	\item If $x=s_x$ or $y=s_y$, the hydrologists can determine which direction the water source is in.
	      \end{itemize}
	      	              
	      Note that both the above events can happen at the same time. Below is an example with $n=10$ and $(s_x, s_y)=(3, 4)$. 
	      The water source is marked with \textsf{\textbf{S}}. Drilling in a shaded square will break the drill bit, and drilling in 
	      a square with a triangle will reveal the direction.

	      	      Describe (you may do this in words, but with sufficient detail) an algorithm to solve the problem of finding the water source, 
	      	      assuming you can break as many drill bits as you want. Provide a Big-O bound on the number of holes you need to drill to find 
	      	      it with your algorithm. Your algorithm should be as efficient as possible for full marks.\\\\
	      	      You may consult the hydrologists after any drill (and with a constant time complexity cost to do so) to see if 
	      	      the source is in the drilled row or column, and if so which direction the water source is in.\\\\
	      	      (Hint: A linear time algorithm is not efficient enough for full marks.)
	      	
	      	\begin{Solution}
	      	
	      	Approach:
	      	Two dimensional binary search moving in the diagonal direction.
	      	
	      	At most $\log(n^2)=2\log(n) \in O(log(n))$
	      	
	        If in one of the x,y direction we land on the arrows we will no longer move in that direction as we know we are on the right row or column.
	        
	        Clarification: in the code below for part a) and b) the axis is considered to be $(0,0)$ is the top-left most. The point $(1,0)$ is the point to the right of $(0,0)$ in the top column, i.e. moving in right direction for a increase in x.

	      	      which also has a water source you need to help find. However, due to budget cuts, this time you can only break $2$ drill 
	      	      bits (at most) before finding the source. (Note that you are able to use a $3$rd drill bit, but are not allowed to ever break it).
	      	      	      	              
	      	      Write \textbf{pseudocode} for an algorithm to find the source while breaking at most $2$ drill bits, and give a tight Big-O 
	      	      bound on the number of squares drilled (in the worst case). If you use external function calls (e.g. to consult the hydrologist, 
	      	      or to see if the cell you drilled is the source) you should define these, their parameters, and their return values. \\\\
	      	      Your algorithm's time complexity should be as efficient as possible in order to receive marks. 
	      	      (Hint: A linear time algorithm is not efficient enough for full marks.)

	      	from $n=j(j+1)/2$ formula getting $j=(2*n+0.25)^{1/2}-0.5$ taking at most $2$ bits drilled and that is $\in O(n^{1/2})$ being better than $O(n)$ because if $1$ bit breaks we go switch to iterative search.
	      	
	      	So our first jump in the diagonal direction by splitting the jumps in horizontal and vertical is $j$, $j-1$, $j-2$, ..., $0$, giving us a total of $n$ and $n$ in the x and y directions and $n*\sqrt{2}$ in the diagonal if we never break a drill bit meaning the $(n,n)$ is where the $S$ was and this value is bounded by $j=(2*n+0.25)^{1/2}-0.5$ so if we give $n$ as $n*\sqrt{2}$ we still get $O(\sqrt{n})$ even if we break a drill bit we would only have to check that $j$ many spots iterative.
